<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

    My name is Mario Elizalde and I am a self-taught developer with about 1 year of experience. I'm currently looking to make the transition from an Email Copywriter to a software developer role. Have a look through my repos and feel free to reach out if you want to discuss anything that you see here.

    Talk soon,
    Mario
